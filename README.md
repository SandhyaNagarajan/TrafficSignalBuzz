# TrafficSignalBuzz
Have you ever missed a traffic light?
How about solving the real-time problem with Bigdata rather than traditional AI.
Traffic Signal Buzz uses the realtime traffic light/signal data and GPS location of the user and alert the state of the signal.
The purpose of the project is protype a data model which could evolve into preventing collision at traffic intersections.
